# Proposal for Neon Films: Data-Driven Film Production

## 1. Approach

To help Neon Films transition to a data-driven approach, we propose the following steps:

### 1.1 Data Collection and Integration
- **Google Trends**: gather data on audience search trends for movies from google trends
- **OMDB API**: Extract movie metadata (e.g., IMDb ratings, box office earnings, runtime) for films released after 2006.
- **Historical Data**: Utilize the provided `movies.xlsx` dataset to analyze historical trends.

### 1.2 Analysis and Insights
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigate relationships between:
  - Film length and box office earnings.
  - IMDb votes and ratings.
  - Google search trends and IMDb ratings.
  - Google search trends and box office earnings.
- **Audience Preferences**: Identify trending genres, themes, and movie attributes that resonate with current audiences.

### 1.3 Automation and Scalability
- **Monthly Data Refresh**: Develop a Python script to automatically update the dataset with new movie data and Google Trends information.
- **Dashboard Creation**: Build a user-friendly dashboard (e.g., using Tableau or Power BI) to visualize insights for decision-makers.
